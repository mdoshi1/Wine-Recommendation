# Wine Recommendation w/ Neo4j

This Java app gathers wine data from the French [DBpedia](http://fr.dbpedia.org) and stores this data in .csv files for later import into [Neo4j's](https://neo4j.com) graph database. Through Neo4j, users can receive wine recommendations based on several wine characteristics (e.g. region, localization, subregion, grapes) and similar users' preferences.

Work done at Institut Supérieur d'Électronique de Paris ([ISEP](http://isep.fr)) under guidance from [Dr. Raja Chiky](http://perso.isep.fr/rchiky/).
