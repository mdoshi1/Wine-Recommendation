# Wine Recommendation w/ Neo4j

This Java app gathers wine data from the French [DBpedia](http://fr.dbpedia.org) and stores this data in .csv files for later import into Neo4j's graph database. Through Neo4j, users can receive wine recommendations based on several wine characteristics (e.g. region, localization, subregion, grapes) and similar users' preferences.
